# Hangman-Game
The hangman game is a simple game of hangman with a camping theme! 

## Game Play
If you're a lover of camping, you will enjoy and likely excel at this game. When a player begins, a random word is chosen and displayed on the page in the form of underscores. Guess a letter by entering a key and try to complete the word before the n umber of guesses remaining reaches zero. Once you complete the full word or run out of guesses, the game is over, wins/losses are updated and a new random word is chosen.

## Getting Started
Simply download the zip file and run index.html in your browser of choice.

## Built With
* [Bootstrap V3](http://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.0.3/docs/) - CSS framework

## Future Ideas
Future enhancements to the app could include:
* Adding a hangman character to the page that builds out as the number of guesses gets closer and closer to zero. 
* Display an image or gif of the chosen word once the game ends.
* Replace the alerts with styled modals.

## Collaboration
Feel free to share any ideas or enhancements! If you'd like to get into the code yourself, please create an issue, fork the repository, make a new branch and send through a PR for review.
